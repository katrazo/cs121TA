1. Which sorting algorithm recursively divides the array in half and then recombines the
   subarrays in order?

   **Binary Search**

   _(The only other search we know is linear search, which does not divide anything.)_


2. Which sorting algorithm repeatedly finds the smallest element of the unsorted tail of an array
   and moves it to the front?

   **Selection Sort**

   _(Selection sort sorts left-to-right, asserting that everything left of the current position is already sorted, and anything to the right (tail) is unsorted.)_


3. Which sorting algorithm places all the elements less than the pivot value on the left side and
   all the elements greater than the pivot value on the right?

   **Quick Sort**

   _("pivot" exists only in quick sort)_


4. Which sorting algorithm compares neighboring elements in array and swaps them if they are
   not in order?

   **Bubble Sort** 

   _(goes through and swaps two values next to each other)_


5. Which sorting algorithm asserts that the first element in the array is the sorted subsection,
   then looks at each subsequent element and places it in its correctly ordered place?

   **Insertion Sort**
   
   _(starts at index 1 instead of 0)_
