# cs121TA
In-class and homework/project activities I completed alongside the students during the Spring 2024 term. This repository serves as an example for them and a portfolio for me.
Each folder in this repository is its own IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition project and should be treated as such. Below is a chart outlining the pourpose of each project.

[Note: I was a TA for both CS121 section 1 and CS121 section 4. In the enumerating of the activities, there became a discrepancy between the dates the activities took place and the numbers assigned to them, between the professors of these two sessions respectively. As such, the enumeration of these folders is akin to that used in CS121 section 4.]

| Troubleshooting | Though I only used this once, I made it as a way to test other people's code when they had issues. Each student would then have their own package in the IntelliJ project. |
| CS121 Instructions For GitHub Desktop | Lab 15 showed us how to integrate Git and GitHub into an IntelliJ project. This single project was intended to be a more or less comprehnsive portfolio of students' work. However, much like the way this repository is structured, many students did not do this, instead putting each activity into a new project. These are instructions written in HTML (and formatted into a PDF) that shows students how to upload all projects to one GitHub repository for a comprehensive portfolio, much like my repository here. |
